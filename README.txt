The MADAI Workbench is the primary visualization software of the
Modeling and Data Analysis Initiative (MADAI). The software extends
the ParaView (http://www.paraview.org) visualization software with a
set of plugins that implement algorithms necessary to produce
visualizations of data produced by MADAI and its collaborators.

The latest public releases of the MADAI Workbench are available at
