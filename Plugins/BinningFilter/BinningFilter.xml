          long_help="Binning Filter injects values from input points into a structured points (volume) dataset. As each point is injected, it contributes to a single voxel/bin.

This filter is typically used to convert point-valued distributions into a volume representation. The volume is then usually iso-surfaced or volume rendered to generate a visualization. It can be used to create surfaces from point distributions, or to create structure (i.e., topology) when none exists.

The input to this filter is any dataset type. This filter can be used to resample any form of data, i.e., the input data need not be unstructured.

Some voxels may never receive a contribution during the splatting process. The final value of these points is 0."
