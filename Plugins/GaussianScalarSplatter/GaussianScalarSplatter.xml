          long_help="This is a VTK filter class as well as a ParaView Plugin that makes use of the filter.  The filter can be applied to any vtkDataSet that has PointData, but is intended for use on vtkPolyData that contains a set of points.

For each vtkDataArray attached to the points, this filter will Gaussian splat those values into a vtkImageData grid.  The only user-set parameter is StandardDeviation, the standard deviation of the Gaussians used for the splat.

The output will have one aditional vtkDataArray called NumberDensity which simply gives the number of points."
